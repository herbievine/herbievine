### Hey, I'm Herbie ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at Highlands College, Jersey, studying Information Technology.

I love creating & developing web apps. I've always been captured by the endless posibilities of the web and what it has to offer.

Programming has also driven me to learn how to build apps for Android/iOS using Flutter and Dart.
